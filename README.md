# WireRouter
Takes an input file and returns the best wire path for the input file.

## About

This program takes in an input file and than proceeds to find the best path to get from point A -> point B.
This is without running into something such as another wire, a wall, or an obstacle. :bricks:


The program uses a Breaths-First Search in order to get the initial results, and than if it cannot get the result, it will reorder the wires and try to solve again to find a better path.
